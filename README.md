## delete-files-by-extension-and-age

this is nodejs script to delete certain file type by its own file age. the script will recursively go through all folder and sub folder and keep in track of found file to delete them later.

## how to use

within index.js file there is three constants that are capitalized within config.json file. those are the three variables that you need to be changing. if you are using this script on windows, make sure to put two backward slash on path. other wise it will messed up.

for example (windows):

```json
{
    "PATH": "C:\\Users\\konyein\\Desktop\\test",
    "FILE_EXTENSION": "txt",
    "DAYS": 14
}
```

for example (unix/mac):

```json
{
    "PATH": "/Users/konyein/Desktop/test",
    "FILE_EXTENSION": "txt",
    "DAYS": 14
}
```

if the files end wit .js, .txt, .pdf, you wanna drop the . and only put the extension after the .
